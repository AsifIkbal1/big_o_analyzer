# **Big-O Analyzer**  

Big-O Analyzer is a Python package designed to help developers analyze and visualize the time complexity of their functions. It allows users to measure runtimes of functions for various input sizes and plot the results for easy understanding of their Big-O notation.

---

## **Features**
- Measure runtime of any Python function for a range of input sizes.
- Visualize time complexity growth with clear, labeled plots.
- Supports comparison of multiple functions (e.g., linear vs. quadratic).
- Easy to use and highly customizable.

---

## **Installation**

You can install Big-O Analyzer directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install big_o_analyzer
```

---

## **Usage**

Here’s a quick example to get started:

### **1. Analyze a Function**
Define the functions you want to analyze and their input generators:

```python
from big_o_analyzer import BigOAnalyzer

def linear_function(data):
    for _ in data:
        pass  # Simulates O(n)

def quadratic_function(data):
    for i in data:
        for j in data:
            pass  # Simulates O(n^2)

# Input sizes to test
input_sizes = [100, 200, 400, 800]

# Function to generate input data
input_generator = lambda size: list(range(size))

# Measure runtimes
runtimes_linear = BigOAnalyzer.measure_runtime(linear_function, input_generator, input_sizes)
runtimes_quadratic = BigOAnalyzer.measure_runtime(quadratic_function, input_generator, input_sizes)

# Plot results
BigOAnalyzer.plot(input_sizes, [runtimes_linear, runtimes_quadratic], ["O(n)", "O(n^2)"])
```

### **2. Visualize Results**
The above code generates a plot comparing the runtime of the `linear_function` and `quadratic_function` across various input sizes. This allows you to infer their Big-O complexities.
